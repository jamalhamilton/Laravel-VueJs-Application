  <h2>A Revolution in the Showchoir World</h2>

  <div class="slim-width">
    <p class="intro">Carmen has been working with some of the most affluent showchoirs in the
    country to develop the best scoring system in the world.</p>

    <p>Our system consists of detailed categories developed after years of study and consultation with the top showchoir judges in America. Our research revealed the need for evaluation criteria that pinpoint the exact characteristics of what it means to have a great performance. This led us to elements that are not often considered in scoresheets, like innovation, difficulty, objectives, and atmosphere, truly setting Carmen apart from the rest.</p>

    <p>Using our knowledge of science and artistic expression, we have produced the fastest, most accurate, most detailed, and easiest to use system available. For 2017 season, we are launching a new version of the Carmen System that is bringing even more agility and flexibility, and a new interface that makes the judge’s interaction more intuitive. Say no more to wasted time and wasted paper! Everything is accessed through our brand new WebApp!</p>

    <p>Take a look below to find out what exactly makes Carmen the best scoring system out there.</p>
